// Then click the 'Generate Atlas' button to create a texture named AtlasName. Then use Unity's sprite editor to slice
// up the atlas like normal, or do whatever else you like with it.
//
// Note: There is nothing that prevents you from having more textures than can fit in the atlas for the given cell size,
// so watch out!
